            You could find me welding new floor panels into large commercial waste containers.  I was a roll-off repair specialist for a national waste management company.  I got to do a lot of painting, a lot of torch cutting, and a lot of welding.  Unsurprisingly, the bottom of a waste container isn't known for being the greatest work environment and often times I feared what might be happening to my long-term health.  Outside of the deep personal satisfaction I got from using my hands to build things, I realized that the work wasn't rewarding enough to make significant forward progress in my life.

            Working for Eisenbeiss was one of best experiences of my life.  When I entered the company, my main responsibility was to degrease, clean, and recondition parts.  Over a couple months I was able to use resources available to teach myself how to read technical drawings and created the opportunity to advance within the company.  Soon enough, I would be re-assembling gearboxes that in a few short months would be shepherding commuters on the light-rail system in St. Louis, MI.  The next would be a machine fresh off the potato chip extrusion line from Frito-Lay, due for a service.  The work was great because my creative mind was stimulated and my hands were busy building.  Every new gearbox was a new puzzle to solve, and I loved it.  It was during this time when a personal hobby turned into an exciting new career prospect.
