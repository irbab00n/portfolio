  about: 'Everything that you have seen so far on this website has been an absolute joy to build.  As a labor of love, my portfolio has been one of the best resources for my continually developing front-end skills.  I have combined the most popular JS front-end framework, React, with a technique known as CSS-in-JS to create a highly interactive and performant user experience.  It is packed full of unique features, inluding a custom built simulated scrolling navigation that preserves single-page architecture.',

  about: 'TrainerFinder was my thesis project while I was student at Hack Reactor.  Within 4 weeks, my team and I had to jump into a semi-built codebase, figure out what pieces have already be implemented and then build our product on top of it.  We elected to build a platform for personal trainers and trainees alike to be able to connect and conduct their personal training business.  This project features a multi-tier user system, depending on the type of account that the user creates.  Trainers have access to an entire dashboard where they can create and view their appointments and message clients.  Clients who have trained with trainers of whom they purchased appointments can provide ratings for other potential clients to use in their appointment purchasing decision.  We ended up integrating React Router to allow for pagination, browser navigation and the ability to refresh the page.',

  about: 'Vagabondly, the best app for trip curation and exploration!  Or in our minds at least that is how it felt to be able to re-design and re-implement the entire front-end.  This project was what is considered the Hack Reactor Legacy project.  Legacy meaning that this was a project that was started 1 week prior by another team within my cohort.  Very quickly, my team and I realized that the front-end on this project was in a desperate need of an overhaul.  We had to read and understand how the existing codebase on the server and database side works, and then design a new front-end to display information that we were retrieving from the Yelp Search API.  Built entirely in React, my code contains a blend of Material UI components with custom-built components to deliver a very guided step-by-step trip creation experience.',
