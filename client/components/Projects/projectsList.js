Within 4 weeks, my team and I had to jump into a semi-built codebase, figure out what pieces have already be implemented and then build our product on top of it.  We elected to build a platform for personal trainers and trainees alike to be able to connect and conduct their personal training business.  This project features a multi-tier user system, depending on the type of account that the user creates.  Trainers have access to an entire dashboard where they can create and view their appointments and message clients.  Clients who have trained with trainers from whom they purchased appointments are able to rate and review the trainer.  This was a great period of growth in my understanding of client-side rendering versus server-side rendering, and how to maintain pagination within a React application.',

Very quickly, my team and I realized that the front-end on this project was in a desperate need of an overhaul.  We had to read and understand how the existing codebase on the back-end, and then design a new front-end to display information that we were retrieving from the Yelp Search API.  Built entirely in React, my code contains a blend of Material UI components with custom-built components to deliver a very guided step-by-step trip creation experience.',
