The main challenge of our thesis was to use a starter repo designed to simulate an in-progress codebase and build our product on top of it.  I converted the server-side rendering into a React client that featured multi-tier user types to create a platform for personal trainers to create and manage their clients, appointments, and payments.  My team and I also designed a system for clients to rate and review trainers to provide more visualization to potential customers.',

Legacy meaning that we inherited the codebase from another team within the cohort, and given one week to improve the application and implement a new feature.  Right away, my team and I identified that we could improve the user interface by making the trip planning process more linear by introducing a step-by-step trip creator.  This allowed us to display more information to the user, allow them to filter by price, and see a map view of where the attractions are in their destination city.',
